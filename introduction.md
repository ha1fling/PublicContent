# Why I learned to code: 

I came up with the idea of Cyber Fount as it’s something that would have helped me, and I wanted it to help others in the future. That was 2017, and there’s still a need for it. 

It’s a software solution, but not one that’s made to make money, so many have told me it’s not worth my time and effort. Anything that helps others get through something that I streuggled with is worth my time and effort. 

I tried to figure out how to monetise it, but every time it became something it shouldn’t be. I need an income to live, but I don’t need my passion projects to make money. Donations towards the project however, have proven to be a good idea, and my small money stream from Patreon which I’m so greatful for helps me fund the software and hosting needed to build this platform.

Cyber Fount exists in my head and in bits and pieces of code currently, and it will be an online resource to answer all the questions I had when getting into Cyber. It’s for those who think like me, who ask the questions that are sometimes branded stupid because they are so out of the box. Dyslexic-thinking is a brilliant thing.

That thinking is what makes me a good software engineer and I’m not ashamed of asking the weird and wonderful questions I do. I learned to code to create a platform to share the answers to these weird questions that I discovered myself, because no existing platform would display the information in the way I hope Cyber Fount will.
